ABOUT FIBONACCI LIGHT
------------

Fibonacci Light is a theme for Drupal 8.  It is a flexible theme
with a responsive and mobile-first layout, supporting two sidebars and full bleed regions.

The theme is named after Fibonacci (Leonardo da Pisa,  1170 - 1250), Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be "the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages".  Fibonacci popularized the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system in the Western World primarily through his composition in 1202 of Liber Abaci (Book of Calculation).  He also introduced Europe to the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
